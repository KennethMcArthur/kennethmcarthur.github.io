			<!-- FEATURES -->
			<h1 align=center><b>Features</b></h1>
			<br>
			<h2>Ultimate Character Customization</h2>
			<div class="clearfix">
				<img src="images/char_creation.png" class="col float-md-end mb-3 ms-md-3 rounded-3" alt="..." height="20%" width="20%">
				<p class="blockquote">
				  	The character is everything, it's our projection in the game world, it's ourself!
					Because of this, being able to customize your character is the fundation of the entire
					game. But we at <em>FRAUD</em> don't like pre-made characters, they are the embodiment of developers laziness
					to add more options. Sliders, you say? They are basically pre-made characters, just more of them.
					We wanted something better, that's why we came up to the idea of a fully customizable character that can be
					exactly how you want!
					No sliders, no pre-made options, just the total freedom to add anything to the model.
					With our system, the character is truly unique because if you are, it must be too.
				</p>
			</div>

			<br>

			<h2>Truly Unique Loot</h2>
			<div class="clearfix">
				<img src="images/NFT_Icon.png" class="col float-md-end mb-3 ms-md-3" alt="..." height="20%" width="20%">
				<p class="blockquote">
					Have you ever found the most powerful, legendary sword, just to realize that everyone has the exact same weapon?
					Has any blacksmith ever forged the exact same weapon twice?<br>
					We at <em>FRAUD</em> like unique things to be really unique, this is why we entwined our loot system with the most recent
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token" target="_blank">NFT</a> technology. By signing each piece of loot with an unique number from the blockchain, we can assure that no
					two players will have the same equipment at any given time. Also this means that now pure crafting-based characters
					can finally have the full time job they always wanted!
				</p>
			</div>

			<br>

			<h2>Full Player-Driven Quests System</h2>
			<div class="clearfix">
				<p class="blockquote">
					<img src="images/questgiving.png" class="col float-md-start mb-3	" alt="..." width="15%" height="15%">
					Did you just finished all quests in a zone and are about to leave towards the next?
					<br>NOT HAPPENING. In <em>SCAMM</em> you'll NEVER run out of quests.<br>
					We at <em>FRAUD</em> think that a fixed questline kills the immersion of a world, the very idea of "finishing a zone" is
					weird and unnatural.<br><img src="images/questreceiving.png" class="col float-md-end mb-3 ms-md-3 rounded-3" alt="..." width="20%" height="20%">
					To address this, we decided to give the power to create quests to the most powerful system in the world: the Players.
					Generating quests is as easy as thinking: pick something you need to be done, choose a fitting reward and tell everybody
					in the game that you have a quest for them. You'll make friends REALLY fast!
				</p>

			</div>

			<br>

			<h2>Full Integrated Compatibility with IoT</h2>
			<div class="clearfix">
				<img src="images/IoT.png" class="col float-md-end mb-3 ms-md-3 rounded-3" alt="..." height="20%" width="20%">
				<p class="blockquote">
					We want our player to truly be immersed in the world of <em>SCAMM</em>, at a level where you could interact with the world itself.
					That's why the game automatically connects to every device that supports <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things" target="_blank">Internet of Things</a> in your home and give to each
					of them a place and a role in <em>SCAMM</em>.
					Maybe you could warm bread with your IoT toaster to complete a quest, or turn you Smart TV into a remote-view magical device
					to check your foes' actions.
					But being in <em>SCAMM</em> world can also be dangerous in many way, monsters lurking in the dark are known to take control of
					IoT devices and turn them against their owners.
					You may defeat your wall-clock alone, but better form a group to destroy that fridge!
				</p>
			</div>

			<br>

			<h2>Limitless World</h2>
			<div class="clearfix">
				<img src="images/EtD.png" class="col float-md-end mb-3 ms-md-3 rounded-3" alt="..." height="25%" width="25%">
				<p class="blockquote">
					We wanted the biggest world ever made. Soon we realized that even that wouldn't be big enough because our players deserve
					way more that that.
					That's why <em>SCAMM</em> employes a special technology called "EtD" that allows the game to connect the player to every other world
					ever made.
					Yes, EVERY world imagined in other games can be accessed from SCAMM for a seamless experience through many different realities
					trascending even game genres.
					All you have to do is to access the special portal and click on the "EtD" button and then choose which other world to visit.
					Possibilities are endless, with <em>SCAMM</em>.
